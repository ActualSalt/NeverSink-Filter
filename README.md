**TESTING THE FILTER:**

--------------------------

The website *[filterblade.xyz](http://www.filterblade.xyz)* is a user-friendly way to install, simulate and (if you want to) modify the filter and is my recommendation. You can do the following things there

--------------------------

**SUPPORT:**

--------------------------

The filter itself will always be free, including updates. There will never be any premium/donator versions or options! However, if you want to support the the development of the filter and/or filterblade or just show your appreciation feel free to **[buy me a beer / donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=6J3S7PBNDQGY2)**. I also have a **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user/overview?u=8230879)** account:

**PICKING A STRICTNESS:**

--------------------------

The strictness defines how many items are filtered. A higher strictness means less items will be shown. I recommend using the regular or semi-strict version if you're just starting. 

Path of Exile is a game, where speed matters a lot. Every time you pick up an item - you slow down. As your character becomes more and more optimized, it's a much better strategy to focus on clearing fast and only pick up the best items. This way you get more experience, less stash-sorting and more chances for big drops. 

The filter strictness setup is designed to reflect that philosophy. You can start with regular/semi-strict and just increase your strictness as you improve your build. Alternatively if you feel like farming slow content, just go down a strictness.

You can also design your own strictness settings on *[filterblade.xyz](http://www.filterblade.xyz)*

- **Soft** = A very low strictness version, that shows extra bases and recipes. Not recommended for most situations.
- **Regular** = Shows all rares and some "potentially useful items", great for solo selffound environments.
- **Semi-Strict** = Shows the top ~60% of all rares, hides less popular recipes and crafting bases. This is a good allrounder version
- **Strict** = Shows the top ~20% of all rares, hides most recipes and crafting bases. Hides scrolls. Designed for optimized builds, that want to farm/grind effectively.
- **Very Strict** = Shows the top ~10% of all rares, hides scrolls, armorers, augmentations. Only shows the best crafting bases and recipes. Designed for fast, well geared builds.
- **Uber Strict** = Shows the top ~1% of all rares, hides transmutations and whetstones. Designed for optimized for rapid content farming.
- **Uber+ Strict** = No rares, no currency under an alch, hides a ton of other things. Designed to keep your screen clean in the most extreme of environments. Customize on filterblade and don't complain if it's too strict.

--------------------------

**STYLE VARIATIONS:**

--------------------------

Different styles have the same filtering pattern and also have the same filter subversions (seen above), but use different highlighting settings. The subversions can be found in the subdirectories. I recommend previewing them on FilterBlade, most styles "just" change the visuals, however the **CUSTOMSOUNDS** style is special: 

Same visuals, but all sounds are different. Designed for streamers or viewers so that they don't get confused when the other side is getting an expensive drop. You can also replace the sound files with your own files (filterblade offers streamer-sound packs and tools to assist you with custom soundpacks)

--------------------------

**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

--------------------------

1) Download the latest filter from *[filterblade.xyz](http://www.filterblade.xyz)* or from the "releases" section. 

2) Extract the files using WinRar/7zip or a similar tool.

3) Paste the .filter files (or just the folder content, if you want to use a specific style, paste the files from one of the (STYLE) folders instead) into the following folder: *%userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile*

4) INGAME: Escape -> Options -> UI -> Scroll down -> Select one of the filters from the dropdown box.

5) Done. Enjoy.

If you want to edit the filter in a text-editor I've create a *[notepad++](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NotepadPP-PoE-Filter-Markup-Language)* and a *[visual studio code](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/VS-Code-PoE-Filter-Markup-Extension)* filter highlight language!
